title: Crash course in handling my name

First of all, I'm very grateful that you're willing to click the link and glance at this page.
Chinese name can be hard to write and pronounce. This guide deals with the prounciation part. 

## Prounciation tricks

Over the years, I have developed a set of tricks to help non-chinese-native speakers prounce my name. 
Feel free to pick the one works best for you!

- You can break "Zeyuan" as "Ze-Yuan", which represents two Chinese characters: "Ze" and "Yuan".
"Ze" can be prounced as "ch" or "Z" and "Yuan" shares the same prouncation with Chinese currency
unit: "Yuan" (the spelling is not the same though). I find this trick works particularly well in
the econ department.
- Facebook helps me to figure out the prounciation as "ZE-yoo-AHN HOO". Sounds pretty close.
- Simply call me "Zack" and forget about the Chinese prounciation nonsense.

If you use a trick that is different from above, feel free to shoot me an email.


## FAQ

I notice you write "Ze-Yuan" and "Zeyuan" interchangeably. Are they the same? What's the difference
between those two?

> Thanks for asking. That's a very good question. [Chinese given name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#East_Asia)
can be very different from Western naming conventions. Technically, Chinese names are usually formed by
two Chinese characters. Usually, any two-character combinations can work and they do not necessarily form
a word. The definition of word can be ambiguous in Chinese because a word in Chinese can be formed by a
single Chinese character or two characters. One may argue that a Chinese character is best considered as
a [morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme). Thus, whether we use hyphen or not when writing Chinese names in
Pinyin really depends on whether those two characters can form a word. For example, "Ze" means water in Chinese
and "Yuan" means travelling further. Those two characters combined together doesn't form a word with a valid
semantics and should be treated as two words. Thus, "Ze-Yuan" is more appropriate than "Zeyuan". However, in my passport,
"Zeyuan" is used (of course, all capitalized), thus "Zeyuan" should be used more for legal documents. So, to sum up,
use either "Ze-Yuan" or "Zeyuan" is fine but "Ze-Yuan" is slightly better.

That's it! Thanks for reading!
