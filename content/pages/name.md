First of all, I'm very grateful that you're willing to click the link and glance at this page.
Chinese name can be hard to write and pronounce. This guide deals with prounciation part. 

## Prounciation tricks

Over the years, I have developed a set of tricks to help non-chinese speakers prounce my name. 
Feel free to pick one that works for you the best!

- [Prounciation audio clip]({attach}/assets/hzy.wav) (last name comes first)
- You can break "Zeyuan" as "Ze-Yuan", which represents two Chinese characters: "Ze" and "Yuan".
"Ze" can be prounced as "ch" or "Z" and "Yuan" shares the same prouncation with Chinese currency
unit: "Yuan" (the chinese spelling is not the same though). I find this trick works particularly well in
the econ department.
- Facebook helps me to figure out the prounciation as "ZE-yoo-AHN HOO". Sounds pretty close.
- In the Wade-Giles system of romanization, my name is rendered as Tse-YÃ¼an Hu.

If you use a trick that is different from the above, feel free to shoot me an email.

## FAQ

- I notice you write "Ze-Yuan" and "Zeyuan" interchangeably. Are they the same? What's the difference
between those two?

> Thanks for asking. That's a very good question. [Chinese given name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given_name#East_Asia)
can be very different from Western naming conventions. Technically, Chinese names are usually formed by
two Chinese characters. Usually, any two-character combinations can work and they do not necessarily form
a word. Unlike word in English, definition of word is ambiguous in Chinese because a word in Chinese can be formed by a
single Chinese character or two characters, and we do not have space as separator of words. One may argue that a Chinese character is best considered as
a [morpheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheme). Thus, whether we use hyphen or not when writing Chinese names in
[Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin) really depends on whether those two characters together can form a word with a valid meaning (usually, it's very rare). 
For example, "Ze" means water in Chinese and "Yuan" means travelling further. Those two characters combined together don't form a word with a valid
semantics and thus, should be treated as two words. Therefore, "Ze-Yuan" is more appropriate than "Zeyuan" from lingustic perspective. However, in my passport,
"Zeyuan" is used. So, "Zeyuan" is mainly for legal documents. So, to sum up,
use either "Ze-Yuan" or "Zeyuan" is fine: "Zeyuan" is for legal but "Ze-Yuan" is better from linguistic perspective.

That's it! Thanks for reading!
