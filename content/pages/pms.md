    This statement is my practice from reading the book "[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People)".
    I put statement here so that I can quickly reference it. If you haven't read the book before, I highly recommend it.

**individual**

- treat people with love: avoid bad-mouthing, bad thinking, put-downs, and accusation
- stay curious
- be brave; see change as an exciting adventure and opportunity to make significant contributions
- _"Don't be afraid to fail, be afraid not to try."_
- be giving; seek opportunities to serve and build others
- 做一名儒士，不要出口成脏，用词简练准确，词汇丰富典雅
- 会识人而不评人
- stay humble; 脾气越大，本事越小
- don't make promise casually; once made, strive to achieve (i.e., be responsible by keeping promise)
- focus on circle of influence
- always seek mutual benefit

**software engineer / researcher**

- develop an expertise in a field
