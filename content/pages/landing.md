Welcome to my modest corner of the web! My name is Zeyuan Hu (胡泽远 in Chinese) [^1]. 
I'm a first year master student at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and 
before becoming a longhorn, I spent two years working as a 
software engineer on [Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/). 

I'm interested in storage system. Also, I have
a side interest in language, which usually leads to NLP. You can find more about me on my [LinkedIn page](http://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhu45), 
[resume]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv.pdf) or [CV]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv-long.pdf). 
I enjoy writing ([here](http://zhu45.org/blog2/) and [there](http://zeyuanhu.wordpress.com/)), cooking (e.g., traditional 
[Beijing dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_cuisine)), 
[singing]({filename}songs.md), and getting involved with local church.

I am contactable via. my personal email address ferrishu3886 [AT] gmail [DOT] com and
am on twitter as [@zeyuanhu](https://twitter.com/zeyuanhu).
