Welcome to my modest corner of the web! My name is Ze-Yuan Hu (胡泽远 in Chinese). People usually call me "Zack". 
My day job is as a Software Engineer at IBM working on [Federation Server](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibminfofedeserv), 
which shipped with [DB2](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/), [dashDB](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/cloud-data-services/dashdb/), 
[BigSQL](https://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/hadoop/big-sql.html), and many other IBM data warehouse solutions. 

In my spare time I like to learn more about [programming]({filename}software.md) and
get exposure to machine learning and natural language processing. 
You can also find more about me in my [LinkedIn page](http://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhu45)or my
[resume]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv.pdf). 
Besides writing and programming, I also enjoy [karaoke]({filename}songs.md), drawings, 
and cooking.

I am contactable via. my personal email address ferrishu3886 [AT] gmail [DOT] com and
am on twitter as [@zeyuanhu](https://twitter.com/zeyuanhu)
