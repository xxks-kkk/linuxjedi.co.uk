<img style="float:left; border-right:10px solid white; max-width: 40%" src="images/me2.jpg" alt="photo"/>Welcome to my modest corner of the web! My name is Ze-Yuan Hu (胡泽远 in Chinese) [^1]. 
I'm a first year master student at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and 
before becoming a longhorn, I spent two years working as a 
software engineer on [Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/). 

I'm interested in storage and security. In particular, I'm interested in building reliable storage system
that can best use of underlying hardware and the distributed storage system with emphasis on performance and security.
Also, I have a side interest in human language, which usually leads to NLP. Occasionally, I read papers on
how to crack the deep-learning-based systems.

You can find more about me on my [LinkedIn page](http://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhu45), 
[resume]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv.pdf), [CV]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv-long.pdf), and [StackOverflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1460102/zack). 

When I'm free, I enjoy carrying out some min research projects on some niche topics (e.g. how to write binary search)
in programming and write them down [here](http://zhu45.org/blog2/). I also write random non-technical things [there](https://zeyuanhu.wordpress.com/). 
Besides writings, I like cooking (e.g., traditional 
[Beijing dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_cuisine)), 
[singing]({filename}songs.md), and [drawing](https://ferrishu3886.deviantart.com/).
I also find myself digging the question on how political system and religion (e.g. Christianity and Buddhism) impact social organization and people's way of thinking.

I am contactable via. my personal email address ferrishu3886 [AT] gmail [DOT] com and
am on twitter as [@zeyuanhu](https://twitter.com/zeyuanhu).
