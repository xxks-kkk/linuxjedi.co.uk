Welcome to my modest corner of the web! My name is Zack (Ze-Yuan) Hu (胡泽远 in Chinese). 
I'm a first year master student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) and 
before becoming a longhorn, I spent two years working as a 
software engineer on [Federstion Server](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibminfofedeserv), 
which shipped with [Db2](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/), and many 
other IBM data warehouse solutions. You can find more about me on my [LinkedIn page](http://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhu45), 
[resume]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv.pdf) or [CV]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv-long.pdf). When I'm free, I like to
[write stuff](http://zhu45.org/blog2/) and [sing some songs]({filename}songs.md).

I am contactable via. my personal email address ferrishu3886 [AT] gmail [DOT] com and
am on twitter as [@zeyuanhu](https://twitter.com/zeyuanhu).
