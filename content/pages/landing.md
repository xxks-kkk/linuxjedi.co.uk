<img style="float:left; border-right:10px solid white; max-width: 40%" src="images/me2.jpg" alt="photo"/>Welcome to my modest corner of the web! My name is Zeyuan Hu (胡泽远 in Chinese) [^1]. 
I'm a second year master student at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). In the past, I worked on in-house High-Performance Computing (HPC) engine at [Schlumberger](https://www.slb.com/) and spent two years working as a 
software engineer on [Db2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows](http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/) at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/). 

I'm interested in storage. In particular, I'm interested in building reliable storage system
that can make best use of the underlying hardware and the distributed storage system with emphasis on performance and security.
Also, I have a side interest in human language, which usually leads to NLP. 
You can find more about me on my [LinkedIn page](http://cn.linkedin.com/in/zhu45), 
[resume]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv.pdf), [CV]({attach}/assets/zeyuan-hu-cv-long.pdf), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1460102/zack), and
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iAG5Mj0AAAAJ&hl=en).

When I'm free, I enjoy carrying out some min research projects on some niche topics
in computer science and write them down [here](http://zhu45.org/blog2/). I also write random non-technical things [there](https://zeyuanhu.wordpress.com/). 
Besides writings, I like cooking (e.g., traditional 
[Beijing dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_cuisine)), 
[singing]({filename}songs.md), and curling.
I also find myself digging the question on how political system and religion (e.g. Christianity and Buddhism) impact social organization and people's way of thinking.

I am contactable via. my personal email address ferrishu3886 [AT] gmail [DOT] com and
am on twitter as [@zeyuanhu](https://twitter.com/zeyuanhu).
