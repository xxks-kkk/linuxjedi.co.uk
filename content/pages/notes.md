title: Misc notes

Over the years, I made some notes using LaTex. Some of them are
coure projects that themselves serve well for future references.

- **[Working with Linux Kernel]** (2018): it is the first lab of [Advanced OS course](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/witchel/380L/lab/lab0.html) at UT. However, I finish it not for the course but to get in 
[Prof. Emmett Witchel](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~witchel/)'s research lab. The note itself is about setting up KVM, 
compile the kernel, and trace the kernel behavior inside a test program.
