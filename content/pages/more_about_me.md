title: So you'd like to know more about me?

I come from Beijing, China and both of my parents are also raised in the city. 
So, I really love Beijing, especially in her traditional form. 

My favorite artists are [Escher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._C._Escher) and
[Rob Gonslaves](http://huckleberryfineart.com/artist/rob-gonsalves/). I really love
their art style.
