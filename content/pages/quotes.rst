"Now I've actually always found something that to be very true which is most
people don't get those experiences because they'd never asked. I've never
found anybody that didn't want to help me if I asked them for help. I always
call him up I called up this will date me but I called up Bill Hewlett when I
was 12 years old and he lived in Palo Alto. His number was still in a phonebook
and he answered the phone himself you know. "yes?" "hi I'm Steve Jobs I'm 12 years
old I'm a student in high school and I want to build a frequency counter and I
was wondering if you had any spare parts I could have?" and he laughed and he gave
me the spare parts to build his frequency counter and he gave me a job
that summer in Hewlett Packard working on the assembly line putting nuts and
bolts together on frequency counters. He got me a job in the place that built him
and I was in heaven and I've never found anyone who said no or hung up the phone
when I call. I just asked and when people ask me I try to be as responsive to pay
that that debt of gratitude back. Most people never pick up the phone and call.
Most people never ask and that's what separates sometimes the people that do
things from the people that just dream about them. You got it. You got to act and
you've got to be willing to fail. You've got to be willing to crash and burn, you
know, with people on the phone, with starting a company, with whatever. If
you're afraid of failing, you won't get very far."
**-- Steve Jobs** (found `on YouTube <https://youtu.be/zkTf0LmDqKI>`__ through `this post <http://harouneducationventures.com/blog/2016/8/29/steve-jobs-on-dont-be-afraid-to-ask-for-help>`__)

"腾讯副总裁吴军博士说“成功的道路并不像想象得那么拥挤，因为在人生的马拉松长路上，绝大部分人跑不到一半就主动退下来了。
到后来，剩下的少数人不是嫌竞争对手太多，而是发愁怎样找一个同伴陪自己一同跑下去。
因此，教育是一辈子的事情，笑到最后的人是一辈子接受教育的人。回过头来看，一些过去比我们读书更优秀，
在起跑线上抢到了更好位置的人，早已放弃了人生的马拉松，我们能够跑得更远，仅仅是因为我们还在跑，如此而已。”急功近利不好，悲观绝望也不好。”
**-- 子修** （出自 `知乎 <https://www.zhihu.com/question/31740233/answer/68760775>`__)

"据我观察，大多数人会在本科毕业的时候就选择了不努力，少数人在坚持硕士或者博士毕业后开始不努力，更少数人能熬到走到社会上之后第一次成功，
然后在第一次失败的打击之下选择了不努力。极少数在不断失败之后还能起来的人，几乎都成为了我们所熟知的名人。
不瞒你说，我认识的长辈里有不少是90年代天之骄子，一时全城名声大噪风光无两，然而现在。。。选择放弃才是常态，不放弃是极少数。”

"The Master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work 
and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his 
education and his recreation, his love and his religion. 
He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence
in whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing.
To him he is always doing both."
**-- Zen Philosophy**

"It is important for you to realize what grades in this class reflect and what they don't reflect. 
All we can grade you on is how well you demonstrate that you know the material this semester. 
We can't grade you on how much of a success you'll be after graduation, 
how smart/creative/persistent/self-motivated you are, or even how well you'll be able to apply the material in the future. 
And after all, it is what you do in the future, not what you do this semester, that's really important."
**-- Prof. Lorenzo Alvisi** (found in his `"Distributed Computing Principles" class grading policy <http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5414/2017fa/>`_)

"There are two kinds of gifts. First, there is the innate gift of a given skill.
*This is a minor gift.* If you have this gift, a skill such as doing math or playing
the piano comes naturally to you. There are millions of people with minor gifts of all
kinds who never do anything great with their gifted skills, because they lack the major
gift.

The *major gift is the love of the work.* This might seem backward. How can love of
using a skill be more important than the skill itself? It is for this simple reason:
if you have a major gift, you will do things with the skills you have. And keep doing
them. And your love of the work will shine through. And through practice, your skills
will grow and become more powerful, until your skills are as great or greater than
someone who only has the minor gift.

There is only one way to find out if you have the major gift.
*Start down the path, and see if it makes your heart sing.*"
**-- From "The Art of Game Design"[Schell '08]**

   
"Don't complain - Expect nothing - Do something"
**-- New York Giants football motto**
   
"Maturation as a scientist involves many components, but a *key one for me was the development of taste,* much as it is in the enjoyment of art, music, food, or wine. One needs to learn what
problems are important. I sensed myself developing taste, distinguishing what was interesting from
what was not - and among the things that were interesting, *I also learned what was doable.*"
**-- Eric Kandel**

"Those who do good science do so because they choose problems that are suited to them."
**-- Lee Smolin**
   
"You should spend at least as much time in the presentation of the work
as you do in the work itself."
**-- Hamming (You and Your Research)**
   
"Though this be madness yet there is method in it."
**-- Shakespeare (Hamlet)**
   
"Ever try? Ever fail? No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better."
**-- Samuel Beckett**
   
"To teach is to learn twice."
**-- Joseph Jouberts**
   
"If you're smart, what you do is make connections. To make
connections, you have to have inputs. Thus, try to avoid having
the same exact inputs as everyone else. Gain new experiences and
thus bring together things no one has brought together before."
**-- Steve Jobs**
   
"Advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise..."
**-- J.R.R. Tolkien**

"It's hard to make something that's interesting... Basically, anything that anyone makes...
It's like a law of nature, a law of aerodynamics, that anything that's written or anything
that's created wants to be mediocre. It's all tending toward mediocrity the way that all
the atoms are dissipating out toward the expanse of the universe. Everything wants to be
mediocre, so what it takes to make anything that is more than mediocre is an *extreme act of will.*
You just have to exert so much will into something for it to be good."
**-- Ira Glass (This American Life)** (found in `Graduate School: Keys To Success <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqPSnjewkuA>`_)
   
"People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man, I'm flesh and blood, I can be ignored, I can be destroyed; but as a symbol... as a symbol I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting."
**-- Bruce Wayne (Batman Begins)**

"I came, I saw, I conquered."

"Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself." 
**-- Publilius Syrus**

"Not every legend is a myth, some are flesh and blood. Some legends walk among us, but they aren’t born, they’re built. Legends are made from iron & sweat, mind and muscle, blood and vision and victory. Legends are champions, they grow, they win, they conquer. There’s a legend behind every legacy, there’s a blueprint behind every legend."
**--  Arnold Schwarzenegger**

   
"Look to the master, follow the master, walk with the master, see through the master, become the master."

"A boss creates fear, a leader confidence. A boss fixes blame, a leader corrects mistakes. A boss knows all, a leader asks questions. A boss makes work drudgery, a leader makes it interesting. A boss is interested in himself or herself, a leader is interested in the group."
**-- Russell H Ewing**
   
"I've always lived cheaply. I live like a
student, basically.  And I like that, because it means that money is not
telling me what to do.  I can do what I think is important for me to do.
It freed me to do what seemed worth doing.  So make a real effort to
avoid getting sucked into all the expensive lifestyle habits of typical
Americans.  Because if you do that, then people with the money will
dictate what you do with your life.  You won't be able to do what's really
important to you."
**-- Richard Stallman**

"Effective interview process: interviewing is a two-way process. During the interview, 
the interviewee is evaluating the company by the interviewing question quality. 
I'd suggest this is one of the most efficient ways to understand your potential coworkers."
-- `ACRush (Tiancheng Lou) on joining Quora <https://www.quora.com/Why-did-ACRush-Tiancheng-Lou-join-Quoras-engineering-team>`_

All you got is life time. Go."
**-- Henry Rollins**

"If you want to become a good programmer, you can spend 10 years programming, or spend
2 years programming and learning algorithms."
**-- Erik Demaine**

"To use an analogy, if algorithms were about automobiles, it would be for the person
who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how one might design fuel-efficient,
safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century. The people who hate algorithms are the ones
who just want to know how to drive their car on the highway, just like everyone else."
**-- Peter Norvig**

"I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate. 
The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting 
although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated."
**-- Bill Gates (found in reddit AMA)**


"Curly braces lead to anger. Anger leads to fear. Fear leads to suffering."
**-- Kensanata on #emacs**

**-- Albert Einstein**

"Talk is cheap. Show me the code."
**-- Linus Torvalds**

aloft; do not seat yourselves on other people's backs and heads."

expression." Now they have two problems."
**-- Jamie Zawinski (found in comp.emacs.xemacs)**

not sleeping and exercising enough. That frees up several hours a day. 
The only downside is that you get fat and die."

"Good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment. 
If things aren't going well it probably means you are learning a lot 
and things will go better later."
**-- Randy Pausch**

begin here."
